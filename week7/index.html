    <h2>What is the Purpose of a Function?</h2>
    <hr>
      <p>A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task when called.</p>

      <!-- Weekly gas average script begins here -->
      <script>
        let name = prompt("Hi there, what's your name?"); // Ask for user's name
        let gasAvg = calcGasAvg(); // Call function to calculate average
        console.log(gasAvg); // Log the average for testing
      
        // Confirm the user's name and gas average (2 decimal places)
        confirm(`Voila! ${name} your average weekly gas bill is $` + gasAvg.toFixed(2));
      
        function calcGasAvg() {
          let count = 0; // Number of valid entries
          let total = 0; // Total of all entries
          let weeklyGas = parseFloat(
            prompt(`Okay ${name}, Enter your FIRST weekly gas total. If this is your only entry, enter -1 on the next screen to end calculation.`)
          );
      
          while (weeklyGas !== -1) {
            total += weeklyGas; // Add to total
            count++; // Increase entry count
            weeklyGas = parseFloat(
              prompt(`Do you have another, ${name}? If so, enter another weekly gas total now. Keep going until you're finished. Then enter -1 to end calculation and get your average.`)
            );
          }
      
          return total / count; // Calculate and return the average
