It was part of a Week 7 assignment to reinforce core JavaScript concepts including loops, conditionals, and function usage.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter their name.
2. The user is prompted to input weekly gas totals (with `-1` used to end input).
3. A function named `calcGasAvg()` is called to:
   - Sum the entered weekly values
   - Count how many entries were made
   - Return the average cost
4. The script then displays a confirmation showing the user's name and their calculated average gas bill, rounded to two decimal places.
