# Week 4 Project: JavaScript Switch Statements

**Author:** Tomira Jefferson (KaitHQ)

**Course:** WEB114 - JavaScript I  

## Project Overview

This project was created for educational purposes and submitted to my professor as part of the Spring 2025 WEB114 course. It demonstrates the use of basic JavaScript logic including conditionals and the `switch` statement. The HTML page is semantically structured and includes both questions and code exercises directly embedded in the file.

## Requirements Completed

- Semantically correct and validated HTML.
- JavaScript embedded directly before the closing `</body>` tag.
- Includes both the assignment question and my answer.
- Interactive JavaScript program using a `switch` statement to respond to user input.
- My name and the date are included as comments at the top of the HTML file.

## Purpose

To demonstrate understanding of the `switch` statement in JavaScript and to practice writing basic logic-driven user interactions.

## How It Works

When the page is opened:
- The user is prompted to enter their favorite day of the week.
- A `switch` statement compares the input and logs a fun message based on the selected day.
- If the input doesn't match a valid weekday, a default message is shown.
